A recent study shows that groundwater, which supplies 98% of the nation's drinking fresh water, is depleting rapidly, causing water shortages in many areas. The UN's SDG 6 ensures "availability and environmentally friendly handling of sanitation and water supplies for all." Natural calamities like floods hurt economies since water is crucial to life. Annual floods in India devastate the people, infrastructure, ecosystem, and economy. India has plenty of water, but UP, Bihar, Gujarat, Bengal, and Karnataka are prone to floods, and more will certainly follow. Due to inadequate infrastructure and management, floods, rainfall, groundwater levels, drainage systems, water distribution, and storage systems increase the frequency and severity of these disasters. This makes utilising surface, ground, or floodwater essential. To prevent losses in flood-prone locations, this study examines all floodwater management system options. Our central idea is to predict floods in advance using Machine Learning with Python and four specific algorithms, like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors and Decision Tree Classifier. The model's extensive application might transform flood management and strengthen communities' resilience to this powerful natural calamity using the latest technologies.

To achieve a high forecast accuracy range, we employ several different methods. Several machine learning methods are applied to pre-processed datasets. Every algorithm provides a certain accuracy level. Everybody goes through it in order to compare.
(i) Logistic Regression: This technique is used to simulate the probability of a class or event, like true or false or pass/fail.
(ii) Naive Bayes: This family of algorithms is based on the idea that each pair of features being classified stands alone from the others.
(iii) K-Nearest Neighbours: This supervised learning technique finds extensive application in intrusion detection, pattern recognition, and data mining.
(iv) Random Forest: This approach aggregates the output of multiple decision trees to arrive at a single conclusion; its popularity has been fuelled by its adaptability, convenience of use, and capacity to handle both regression and classification issues.
